Hey there, this is my first Node.js module. I'm looking forward to 
creating things on this new platform. 

C:\Users\Andrew\Documents\GitHub\WorkingRepo\JavaScript\NodeJS\censorify

LESSON LEARNED: MAKE SURE NO GARBAGE IS IN THE ECLIPSE FOLDER WHEN 
USING npm pack

To install this package: 
npm install censorify-0.1.1.tgz

You may need to copy node_modules to the folder of the  application that requires it.
